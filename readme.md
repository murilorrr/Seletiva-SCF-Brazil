## **Introduction**

This project has a fake database in fakeData.js with only one record.
The idea is to improve the CRUD written in the 4 test files below.

The code writing style will be validated.
Write code that humans can understand.

Feel free to make modifications to the services, code comments, structure, but be concise.

teste1.js
GET on /user

In this file, we have a service that searches the fake database and returns a record.
This code works, but it can be improved.
See what can be done to make it better written and more performant.

teste2.js
POST on /users, discover its intention and correct it.

teste3.js
This file searches for a user and deletes it from the database.
Return success to the client if it has actually been deleted and make the code more performant.

teste4.js
Update the data of a specific user.

teste5.js
Return how many times a particular user has been read in teste1.

teste 6
Define a way to create permission for the user, determine if the user can delete or update users. Create a middleware to validate these permissions and add it to teste4 and teste3.
