## Introduction

This project contains a fake database in `fakeData.js` with only one record. The purpose of this challenge is to improve the CRUD operations written in the following 4 test files.

The code's readability and performance will be evaluated, so it is important to write code that is easily understandable by humans.

#### Teste1.js - GET on `/user`

In this file, there is a service that queries the fake database and returns a single record. While the code works, there is room for improvement. Analyze and implement modifications to make it better written and more performant.

#### Teste2.js - POST on `/users`

This file represents a POST request to the `/users` endpoint. Analyze the code, understand its intention, and correct any issues that you identify.

#### Teste3.js - DELETE on `/users`

This file searches for a user in the database and deletes it if found. Return a success response to the client if the deletion is successful and optimize the code for better performance.

#### Teste4.js - PUT on `/users/:id`

This file updates the data of a specific user identified by the provided ID. Review the code and make any necessary improvements.

#### Teste5.js - GET on `/users/access`

Implement a functionality that returns the number of times a specific user has been accessed in `Teste1.js`.

#### Teste 6 - User Permissions

Define a way to grant permissions to users, allowing or restricting their ability to delete or update other users. Create a middleware function to validate these permissions and apply it to `Teste4.js` and `Teste3.js`.
